use jupyter notebook to run code
Hello, I am from the eDukandar team. To run our python code you can use Jupiter notebook and to run the website you have to first unzip the .rar file and then in the New folder directory, you type 'python manage.py run server' to run the website locally also you need to have Django installed. unfortunately we could not finish our website on time so the graphs might not be visible. This is how our dashboard will finally look like.
